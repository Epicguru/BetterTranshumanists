# Epicguru's Better Transhumanists mod

Increases the number of levels that the transhumanist trait adds. In vanilla, when pawns have 6 body parts replaced they consider their *machine body complete*.
That's lame: there is way more flesh to augment! This mod adds new trait levels all the way up to 14 replaced body parts, granting a maximum mood bonus of +30 compared to the vanilla +13 at 6 parts.

Please open issues or pull requests and I will take a look at them when I get time.
